grc: Used the first part of the Iliad given that I doubt anyone's translating the UDHR
     into ancient Greek anytime soon
nr:  In order to try and distinguish xh, zu and nr from eachother, temporarily set
     MAXNGRAMS  2000
     MAXNGRAMSYMBOL 4
     while generating those three fingerprints as a bit of a bodge
rue: NO UDHR translations available. Visited rue.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:LongPages to get
     a list of Rusyn pages on wikipedia and picked the longest page which didn't seem
     too contaminated with mathematical or characters from different languages and scripts
sd:  The UDHR for Sindhi is basically a picture of the text, so can't extract it. So visited
     sd.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:LongPages and picked the longest page which didn't seem
     too contaminated with mathematical symbols or different script
shs: No UDHR translation available. Nor any lengthy cohesive text. So sample
     text is cut and pasted phrases from http://www.firstvoices.ca/en/Secwepemc/phrase-book
